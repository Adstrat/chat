# Native Mobile Chat App

Chat is a mobile application which provides users with a real-time chat interface and options to share images and maps of their location.

It was developed using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.io). The App also uses the [Gifted Chat library](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat) to create the chat interface and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store messages and images.

## Features

* Users are first taken to a login screen where they enter their name and choose a background colour for the Chat screen.
* The chat screen displays their conversation along with an input area.
* Users can send images from their library, take photos and add a map with their location.
* Message history is stored locally for faster load times and offline use.
